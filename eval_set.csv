How do sourdough strains mitigate intestinal injury in zebrafish fed on a high-fat diet?,"[""['Lactiplantibacillus plantarum', 'Pediococcus pentosaceus', 'FASN', 'Leptin', 'SREBF1', 'Leptin', 'SREBF1', 'Occludin', 'ZO-1', 'Claudin-1', 'TNF-α', 'IL-6', 'IL-1β', 'Acinetobacter', 'Cetobacterium', 'Plesiomonas']\n['8', '-1', '7', '-1']\nThere is significant interest in using postbiotics as an intervention strategy to address obesity. This study assesses the efficacy of postbiotics derived from different sourdough strains ( LP1, LP25, and  PP18) in mitigating intestinal injury in zebrafish fed on a high-fat diet. We screened postbiotics for their anti-colon cancer cell effects and compared various preparation methods applied to live bacterial strains, including heat-killing at different temperatures, pH adjustments, and ultraviolet radiation exposure. Heat-killing at 120 °C proved to be the most effective preparation method. A marked variation in health effects was observed in the heat-killed microbial cells, as evidenced by their hydrophobicity and self-aggregation ability. A five-week high-fat dietary intervention study in zebrafish demonstrated that diets supplemented with 10 CFU g K-LP25 significantly attenuated weight gain and body fat, along with reductions in , , and  mRNA expression.

What was the patient's initial symptom upon visiting the hospital?,"[""Hemangioma is a common vascular neoplasm that arises in the head and neck regions but is rare in the petrous bone. We report the first case of a solitary cavernous hemangioma in the mastoid antrum. A 68-year-old woman visited our hospital with a complaint of tinnitus without any other symptoms. Tinnitus of the right ear occurred especially when the patient yawned or swallowed. Both tympanic membranes appeared normal on otoscopic examination. On pure-tone audiometry, mild hearing loss up to 25 dB was detected in the right ear. Temporal bone computed tomography revealed a 7.0 mm × 4.5 mm × 5 mm, solitary soft tissue mass in the aditus ad antrum. Excisional biopsy was performed under general anesthesia through the canal wall as in a mastoidectomy. The mass was completely removed without any bleeding or ossicular chain damage. The mass was confirmed as a cavernous hemangioma. During follow-up, the patient's tinnitus and right low-tone hearing loss improved. No solitary hemangioma of the mastoid antrum has been reported previously. Surgical excision of the lesion appears to be proper treatment to achieve pathologic confirmation along with resolution of symptoms.""]","The patient visited the hospital with a complaint of tinnitus, a ringing or buzzing sound in the ear, without any other symptoms.",simple,"[{'uid': '39162066', 'Title': 'Cavernous Hemangioma of the Mastoid Antrum.', 'Published': '--', 'Copyright Information': ''}]",True

Operative and pathological reports lack comprehensive information on margins quality and tissue block mapping. Standardizing reports is essential to reduce uncertainties, aiming for less morbid poRT.', 'PURPOSE: This study questions the quality of life of young to mid-life hematology patients during lockdowns in France.\nMETHOD: Fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2022.\nFINDINGS: Thematic content analysis identified three main themes: (1) regulating fear of COVID-19 during the health crisis, (2) maintaining relationships and fostering social support during the pandemic, and (3) removing the stigma of cancer with COVID-19: a positive factor for patients\' quality of life.\nINTERPRETATION: Study participants experienced the restrictions imposed on the entire population in the face of COVID-19 in various ways, including positive events. In fact, for some, the lockdown situation allowed them to better ""fit in"" and feel less stigmatized because of their patient status. Indeed, lifestyles specific to them became common barrier gestures to the whole population.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL PROVIDERS OR POLICY: The results underline the importance of broadening the communication fields and fostering psychosocial skills in these patients.']",The answer to given question is not present in context,multi_context,"[{'uid': '39162093', 'Title': 'Interpretability of operative and pathological reports for radiotherapy planning of sinonasal carcinomas: An ancillary study of the GORTEC 2016-02 SANTAL trial.', 'Published': '2024-08-20', 'Copyright Information': '© 2024 ARS‐AAOA, LLC.'}, {'uid': '39162083', 'Title': 'Experiencing the COVID-19 health crisis: Quality of life of young to mid-life hematology patients.', 'Published': '2024-08-20', 'Copyright Information': ''}]",True
