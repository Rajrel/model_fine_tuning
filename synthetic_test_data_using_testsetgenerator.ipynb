Journal of Neurochemistry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Society for Neurochemistry.'}, page_content='Oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells in the central nervous system (CNS), are crucial for rapid action potential conduction and neuronal communication. While extensively studied for their roles in neuronal support and axonal insulation, their involvement in pain modulation is an emerging research area. This review explores the interplay between oligodendrocytes, myelination, and pain, focusing on neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury (SCI), chemotherapy, and HIV infection. Studies indicate that a decrease in oligodendrocytes and increased cytokine production by oligodendroglia in response to injury can induce or exacerbate pain. An increase in endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) may be a compensatory response to repair damaged oligodendrocytes. Exogenous OPC transplantation shows promise in alleviating SCI-induced neuropathic pain and enhancing remyelination. Additionally, oligodendrocyte apoptosis in brain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex is linked to opioid-induced hyperalgesia, highlighting their role in central pain mechanisms. Chemotherapeutic agents disrupt oligodendrocyte differentiation, leading to persistent pain, while HIV-associated neuropathy involves up-regulation of oligodendrocyte lineage cell markers. These findings underscore the multifaceted roles of oligodendrocytes in pain pathways, suggesting that targeting myelination processes could offer new therapeutic strategies for chronic pain management. Further research should elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms to develop effective pain treatments.'),\n",

This study assesses the efficacy of postbiotics derived from different sourdough strains ( LP1, LP25, and  PP18) in mitigating intestinal injury in zebrafish fed on a high-fat diet. We screened postbiotics for their anti-colon cancer cell effects and compared various preparation methods applied to live bacterial strains, including heat-killing at different temperatures, pH adjustments, and ultraviolet radiation exposure. Heat-killing at 120 °C proved to be the most effective preparation method. A marked variation in health effects was observed in the heat-killed microbial cells, as evidenced by their hydrophobicity and self-aggregation ability. A five-week high-fat dietary intervention study in zebrafish demonstrated that diets supplemented with 10 CFU g K-LP25 significantly attenuated weight gain and body fat, along with reductions in , , and  mRNA expression. However, diets supplemented with 10 CFU g K-PP18 only reduced  and  mRNA expression. K-PP18 was more effective at mitigating gut barrier damage, promoting colonic , , and  levels. Additionally, K-LP25 supplementation markedly downregulated the pro-inflammatory cytokines , , and , reducing intestinal inflammation. Supplementation with K-LP1 and K-PP18 increased the abundance of  spp., whereas K-LP25 increased the abundance of  and . Collectively, these findings suggest that inactivated strains confer protective effects against high-fat diet-induced intestinal damage in zebrafish, with variation observed across different species. Studying the effects of sourdough-derived postbiotics on gut health may open new avenues for dietary interventions to manage gut-related diseases.\"),\n",

We report the first case of a solitary cavernous hemangioma in the mastoid antrum. A 68-year-old woman visited our hospital with a complaint of tinnitus without any other symptoms. Tinnitus of the right ear occurred especially when the patient yawned or swallowed. Both tympanic membranes appeared normal on otoscopic examination. On pure-tone audiometry, mild hearing loss up to 25 dB was detected in the right ear. Temporal bone computed tomography revealed a 7.0 mm × 4.5 mm × 5 mm, solitary soft tissue mass in the aditus ad antrum. Excisional biopsy was performed under general anesthesia through the canal wall as in a mastoidectomy. The mass was completely removed without any bleeding or ossicular chain damage. The mass was confirmed as a cavernous hemangioma. During follow-up, the patient's tinnitus and right low-tone hearing loss improved. No solitary hemangioma of the mastoid antrum has been reported previously. Surgical excision of the lesion appears to be proper treatment to achieve pathologic confirmation along with resolution of symptoms.\")]\n"
